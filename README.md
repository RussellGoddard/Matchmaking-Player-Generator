# Matchmaking-Player-Generator

Very work in progress, see wiki for updates. 

This project is mostly for me to learn various concepts and really push my limits programming wise.

Some things I do probably aren't the best decisions from a getting stuff done perspective, like if the whole project was
in C# I would be much further ahead than where I am now. However the fun is learning, I am not asking myself "is this the best method" but
rather "how can I do this" and this is shown by choosing to mix managed and unmanaged code.
